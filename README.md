# Polygon-arbitage---Gaurav-Jain
This project is a simple simulation of an Arbitrage Detector Bot on the Polygon network. Since I am a fresher, I tried to build a basic version in Robust and C++ .  The bot simulates fetching token prices (WETH/USDC) from two DEXes (Uniswap &amp; QuickSwap), compares them, and checks if there is any arbitrage opportunity after subtracting gas cost.
